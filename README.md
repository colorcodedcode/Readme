# Welcome!
Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub portfolio page. This repository serves as a quick introduction to the page as well as an easy navigation for the future.

### About Me
My name is Robert Schaap and I'm a beginning full stack web developer. I'm in the midst of completing my full stack bootcamp through the New York Code + Design Academy and am looking to get started somewhere early next year in a web development position.

Though it's a bit bleek right now, I plan to use this page to store my portfolio projects and little code snippets. I have a separate account under my own name as well, but that's mainly used for testing.

If you're looking for more info, please come look me up at:
