# Welcome!
Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub portfolio page. This repository serves as a quick introduction to the page as well as an easy navigation for the future.

### About Me
My name is Robert Schaap and I'm a beginning full stack web developer. Mid 2016 I decided to put the breaks on my financial career because I wanted to explore other things. That lead me to sofware development and after a lot of self-study I completed a full stack bootcamp at the New York Code + Design Academy.

Though it needs filling up, this page will store my portfolio projects and little code snippets. I have a separate account under my own name as well (@robertschaap), but that's mainly used for testing and as a sandbox.

If you're looking for more info, please come look me up at and get in touch:
